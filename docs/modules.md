# Modules
Modules, unlike extensions, change how your keyboard works. These are meant to have
the ability to alter the core code in any way. Unlike extensions, these are not in a
sandbox, and can make massive changes to normal operation.

## Core Modules
These modules are proveded in all builds and can be enabled. Currently offered
modules are

- [Layers](layers.md): Adds layer support (Fn key) to allow many more keys to be
put on your keyboard
- [ModTap](modtap.md): Adds support for augmented modifier keys to act as one key
when tapped, and modifier when held.
- [Mouse keys](mouse_keys.md): Adds mouse keycodes
- [OneShot](oneshot.md): Adds support for oneshot/sticky keys.
- [Power](power.md): Power saving features. This is mostly useful when on battery power.
- [Split](split_keyboards.md): Keyboards split in two. Seems ergonomic!
- [TapDance](tapdance.md): Different key actions depending on how often it is pressed.

### Peripherals
- [ADNS9800](adns9800.md): Controlling ADNS9800 optical sensor
- [Encoder](encoder.md): Handling rotary encoders
- [Pimoroni trackball](pimoroni_trackball.md): Handling a small I2C trackball made by Pimoroni
