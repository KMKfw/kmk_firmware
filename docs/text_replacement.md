# Text Replacement

The Text Replacement module lets a user replace one typed sequence of characters with another.

Potential uses:

- Rudimentary auto-correct: replace `yuo` with `you`
- Text expansion, Ã  la [espanso](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso): when `:sig` is typed, replace it with `John Doe`, or turn `idk` into `I don't know`

## Usage

```python
from kmk.modules.text_replacement import TextReplacement

my_dictionary = {
    'yuo': 'you',
    ':sig': 'John Doe',
    'idk': "I don't know"
}
text_replacement = TextReplacement(dictionary=my_dictionary)
keyboard.modules.append(text_replacement)
```

### Recommendations

1. Consider prefixing text expansion entries with a symbol to prevent accidental activations.
2. If you want multiple similar replacements, consider adding a number to prevent unreachable matches: `replaceme1`, `replaceme2`, etc.

### Limitations

1. Since this runs on your keyboard, it is not context-aware. It can't tell if you are typing in a valid text field or not.
2. In the interest of a responsive typing experience, the first valid match will be used as soon as it is found. If your dictionary contains "abc" and "abcd", "abcd" will be unmatchable.
3. Like is the case with [Sequences](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/sequences.md) and [Dynamic Sequences](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/dynamic_sequences.md), characters are sent at a rate of 1 every 10 milliseconds. The replacement will not happen instantly.
4. The text to be replaced is removed by sending backspace taps. As with the previous limitation, this happens at a rate of 1 tap every 10 milliseconds.
