# Sequences

Sequences are used for sending multiple keystrokes in a single action, and can
be used for things like Unicode characters (even emojis! 🇨🇦), _Lorem ipsum_
generators, triggering side effects (think lighting, speakers,
microcontroller-optimized cryptocurrency miners, whatever). If you are still
unsure of what this is, most other vendors call these "Macros", but can do much
more if you wish.

## Sending strings
The most basic sequence is `send_string`. It can be used to send any standard
English alphabet character, and an assortment of other "standard" keyboard keys
(return, space, exclamation points, etc.)

```python
from kmk.handlers.sequences import send_string

WOW = send_string("Wow, KMK is awesome!")

keyboard.keymap = [...WOW,...]
```

## Key sequences
If you need to add modifier keys to your sequence, instead of `send_string` use
`simple_key_sequence`. While it's not as visually clean as `send_string`, you can
use it to add things like copying/pasting, tabbing between fields, etc.

```python
from kmk.handlers.sequences import simple_key_sequence

PASTE_WITH_COMMENTARY = simple_key_sequence(
	(
		KC.L,
		KC.O,
		KC.O,
		KC.K,
		KC.SPC,
		KC.A,
		KC.T,
		KC.SPC,
		KC.T,
		KC.H,
		KC.I,
		KC.S,
		KC.COLN,
		KC.SPC,
		KC.LCTL(KC.V),
	)
)

keyboard.keymap = [...PASTE_WITH_COMMENTARY,...]
```

The above example will type out "look at this: " and then paste the contents of your
clipboard.


### Sleeping within a sequence

If you need to wait during a sequence, you can use `KC.MACRO_SLEEP_MS(ms)` to wait a 
length of time, in milliseconds.

```python
from kmk.handlers.sequences import simple_key_sequence

COUNTDOWN_TO_PASTE = simple_key_sequence(
	(
		KC.N3,
		KC.ENTER,
		KC.MACRO_SLEEP_MS(1000),
		KC.N2,
		KC.ENTER,
		KC.MACRO_SLEEP_MS(1000),
		KC.N1,
		KC.ENTER,
		KC.MACRO_SLEEP(1000),
		KC.LCTL(KC.V),
	)
)

keyboard.keymap = [...COUNTDOWN_TO_PASTE,...]
```

This example will type out the following, waiting one second (1000 ms) between numbers:

    3
    2
    1

and then paste the contents of your clipboard.


## Unicode
Before trying to send Unicode sequences, make sure you set your `UnicodeMode`.
You can set an initial value in your keymap by setting `keyboard.unicode_mode`.

Keys are provided to change this mode at runtime - for example, `KC.UC_MODE_LINUX`.


### Unicode Modes:
On Linux, Unicode uses `Ctrl-Shift-U`, which is supported by `ibus` and GTK+3.
`ibus` users will need to add `IBUS_ENABLE_CTRL_SHIFT_U=1` to their environment
(`~/profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or through your desktop environment's
configurator).

On Windows, [WinCompose](https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose) is required.

- Linux : `UnicodeMode.LINUX` or `UnicodeMode.IBUS`
- Mac: `UnicodeMode.MACOS` or `UnicodeMode.OSX` or `UnicodeMode.RALT`
- Windows: `UnicodeMode.WINC`


### Unicode Examples

To send a simple Unicode symbol
```python
from kmk.handlers.sequences import unicode_string_sequence

FLIP = unicode_string_sequence('(ノಠ痊ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻')

keyboard.keymap = [...FLIP,...]
```

If you'd rather keep a lookup table of your sequences (perhaps to bind emojis to
keys), that's supported too, through an obnoxiously long-winded method:

```python
from kmk.handlers.sequences import compile_unicode_string_sequences as cuss

emoticons = cuss({
	'BEER': r'🍺',
	'HAND_WAVE': r'👋',
})

keymap = [...emoticons.BEER, emoticons.HAND_WAVE...]
```

> The observant will notice dot-notation is supported here despite feeding in a
> dictionary - the return of `compile_unicode_string_sequences` is a
> `kmk.types.AttrDict`, which you can think of as a read-only view over a
> dictionary adding attribute-based (dot-notation) access.

Finally, if you need to send arbitrary Unicode codepoints in raw form, that's
supported too, through `unicode_codepoint_sequence`.

```python
from kmk.handlers.sequences import unicode_codepoint_sequence

TABLE_FLIP = unicode_codepoint_sequence([
	"28", "30ce", "ca0", "75ca","ca0", "29",
	"30ce", "5f61", "253b", "2501", "253b",
])

keyboard.keymap = [...TABLE_FLIP,...]
```
