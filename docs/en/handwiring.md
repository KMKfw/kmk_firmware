# Handwire keyboards
This guide will not talk about the physical wiring. Check out our 
[recommended microcontrollers](Officially_Supported_Microcontrollers.md) and 
follow the amazing guide for that [here](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/hand_wire). That 
guide can be followed until you are setting up the firmware. After wiring the 
keyboard, you can refer to our porting guide [here](porting_to_kmk.md)
