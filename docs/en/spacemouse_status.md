# Spacemouse Status
This extension exposes host-side LED status of the spacemouse.

## Enabling the extension
```python
from kmk.extensions.spacemouse_status import SpacemouseStatus

sm_led = SpacemouseStatus()
keyboard.extensions.append(sm_led)

```

## Read LED Status
Similar to the [Lock Status](lock_status.md) extension, the spacemouse LED 
state can be retrieved with `sm_led.get_led()`, which returns `True`
when the LED is enabled and `False` otherwise.

**Note**:
Support for six_axis has to be explicitly
enabled in `boot.py` with the [`bootcfg` module](boot.md#six_axis).
