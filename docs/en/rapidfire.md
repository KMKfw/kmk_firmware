# RapidFire

The RapidFire module lets a user send repeated key taps while a key is held.

Some instances where this may be useful are:

- MMOs and other games where you are encouraged to repeatedly spam a key
- More responsive volume up and volume down
- Faster cursor key navigation
- Combine with the [Mouse Keys](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/mouse_keys.md) module to create rapid-fire mouse clicks
- Anywhere else you may need an ergonomic alternative to repetitive key tapping

## Keycodes

| Key         | Description                                          |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `KC.RF(kc)` | Repeatedly sends the specified keycode while pressed |

## Usage

Each repeat counts as one full cycle of pressing and releasing. RapidFire works with chording (i.e., holding Shift plus a RapidFire key will repeatedly send the shifted version of that RapidFire key) and chaining (i.e., `KC.RF(KC.LSHIFT(KC.A))`. Multiple RapidFire keys can be held down at the same time, and their timers work independently of each other.

The RapidFire keycode has a few different options:

|             Option              | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :-----------------------------: | :-----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|           `interval`            |     `100`     | The time between key taps sent in milliseconds. Note: `10` appears to be the minimum effective value.                                                                                                                       |
|            `timeout`            |     `200`     | The amount of time in milliseconds the key must be held down before RapidFire activates. Useful if you want to be able to type with keys that have a low `interval` value. A value of `0` will result in no waiting period. |
| `enable_interval_randomization` |    `False`    | Enable randomizing the value of `interval`. Useful for making the repetitive input look human in instances where you may be flagged as a bot otherwise.                                                                     |
|    `randomization_magnitude`    |     `15`      | If `enable_interval_randomization` is `True`, the time between key taps sent will be `interval` plus or minus a random value up to this amount.                                                                             |
|            `toggle`             |    `False`    | If set to `True`, activating RapidFire will toggle it on or off. Useful if you don't want to have to keep the button held. Set `timeout` to `0` if you would like to toggle on tap.                                         |

### Example Code

```python
from kmk.modules.rapidfire import RapidFire

keyboard.modules.append(RapidFire())

# After 200 milliseconds, repeatedly send Shift+A every 75-125 milliseconds while the button is held
SPAM_A = KC.RF(KC.LSFT(KC.A), timeout=200, interval=100, enable_interval_randomization=True, randomization_magnitude=25)
# Immediately toggle repeatedly sending Enter every 50 milliseconds on tap
SPAM_ENTER = KC.RF(KC.ENT, toggle=True, timeout=0, interval=50)


keyboard.keymap = [[
    SPAM_A, SPAM_ENTER
    ]]

```
