# Support

For asynchronous support and chatter about KMK, [join our Zulip
community](https://kmkfw.zulipchat.com)!

If you ask for help in chat or open a bug report, if possible
make sure your copy of KMK is up-to-date.
In particular, swing by the Zulip chat *before* opening a GitHub Issue about
configuration, documentation, etc. concerns.
