# Support

If you need support with KMK or just want to say hi, find us in [#kmkfw:klar.sh
on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#kmkfw:klar.sh). This channel is bridged to
Discord [here](https://discordapp.com/widget?id=493256121075761173&theme=dark)
for convenience.

If you ask for help in chat or open a bug report, if possible
make sure your copy of KMK is up-to-date.
