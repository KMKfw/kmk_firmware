# RGB/Underglow/Neopixel
Want your keyboard to shine? Add some lights!
This does require the neopixel library from Adafruit. This can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel/blob/6e35cd2b40575a20e2904b096508325cef4a71d3/neopixel.py).
It is part of the [Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle).

Simply put this in the "root" of your circuitpython device. If unsure, it's the folder with main.py in it, and should be the first folder you see when you open the device.

Currently we support the following addressable LEDs:

 * WS2811, WS2812, WS2812B, WS2812C, etc.
 * SK6812, SK6812MINI, SK6805
 * All neopixels
 
### Color Selection

KMK uses [Hue, Saturation, and Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) to select colors rather than RGB. The color wheel below demonstrates how this works.

Changing the **Hue** cycles around the circle.
Changing the **Saturation** moves between the inner and outer sections of the wheel, affecting the intensity of the color.
Changing the **Value** sets the overall brightness.

## Hardware Modification

To add RGB LED's to boards that don't support them directly, you will have to add a 3 wires. The power wire will run on 3.3v or 5v (depending on the LED),
ground, and data pins will need added to an unused pin on your microcontroller unless your keyboard has specific solder points for them. With those 3 wires
connected, set the pixel_pin as described above, and you are ready to use your RGB LED's/Neopixels.

## ADVANCED USAGE
If you wish to interact with these as you would normal LED's and do not want help from KMK, you can disable all helper functions from working and access the
neopixel object directly like this.
```python
keyboard.pixels.disable_auto_write = True
keyboard.pixels.neopixel() # <-- This is the neopixel object    
```

## User animations
User animations can be created as well. An example of a light show would look like this
```python
from kmk.keys import make_key

def start_light_show(*args, **kwargs):
    # Setting mode to user will use the user animation
    keyboard.pixels.animation_mode = 'user'


def light_show(self):
    # This is the code that is run every cycle that can serve as an animation
    # Refer to the kmk/rgb.py for actual examples of what has been done
    self.hue = (self.hue + 35) % 360
    keyboard.pixels.set_hsv_fill(self.hue, self.sat, self.val)
    return self


# This is what "gives" your function to KMK so it knows what your animation code is
keyboard.rgb_config['user_animation'] = light_show

# Makes a key that would start your animation
LS = make_key(on_press=start_light_show)

keymap = [...LS,...]
```

## Troubleshooting
### Incorrect colors
If your colors are incorrect, check the pixel order of your specific LED's. Here are some common ones.
 * WS2811, WS2812, WS2812B, WS2812C are all GRB (1, 0, 2)
 * SK6812, SK6812MINI, SK6805 are all GRB (1, 0, 2)
 * Neopixels will vary depending on which one you buy. It will be listed on the product page.# Troubleshooting
 
### Lights don't turn on
Make sure that your board supports LED backlight by checking for a line with "PIXEL_PIN". If it does not, you can add it to your keymap.
If you added the LED's yourself, you will also need to set num_pixels to the number of installed LED's in total.

|Define               |Description                                  |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|`keyboard.pixel_pin` |The pin connected to the data pin of the LEDs|
|`keyboard.num_pixels`|The number of LEDs connected                 |
