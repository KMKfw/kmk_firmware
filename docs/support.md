# Support

If you need support with KMK or just want to say hi, find us in [#kmkfw:klar.sh
on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#kmkfw:klar.sh). This channel is bridged to
Discord [here](https://discordapp.com/widget?id=493256121075761173&theme=dark)
for convenience.

If you ask for help on chat or open a bug report, if possible please give us
your commit SHA, found by running

```python
from kmk.consts import KMK_RELEASE; print(KMK_RELEASE)
```

Per kind user in the chat:
