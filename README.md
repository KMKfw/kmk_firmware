KMK is a feature-rich and beginner-friendly firmware for computer keyboards
written and configured in
[CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython).

## Support

community](https://kmkfw.zulipchat.com)!

If you ask for help in chat or open a bug report, if possible
make sure your copy of KMK is up-to-date.
In particular, swing by the Zulip chat *before* opening a GitHub Issue about
configuration, documentation, etc. concerns.

## Features

- Fully configured through a single, easy to understand Python file that lives
  on a "flash-drive"-esque space on your microcontroller - edit on the go
  without DFU or other devtooling available!
- Single-piece or [two-piece split
  keyboards](/docs/en/split_keyboards.md)
  are supported
- [Chainable
  keys](/docs/en/keys.md) such as
  `KC.LWIN(KC.L)` to lock the screen on a Windows PC
- [Built-in Unicode macros, including
  emojis](/docs/en/sequences.md)
- [RGB underglow](/docs/en/rgb.md)
  and [LED
  backlights](/docs/en/led.md)
- One key can turn into many more based on [how many times you tap
  it](/docs/en/tapdance.md)
- Bluetooth HID and split keyboards. No more wires.

## Getting Started
KMK requires [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) version 7.0 or higher.
