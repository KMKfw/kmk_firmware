# KMK: Mechanical keyboard firmware for humans (and ARM microcontrollers)

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/tree/master)[![CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/readme/badge/KMKfw/kmk_firmware)](https://cla-assistant.io/KMKfw/kmk_firmware)

KMK is a work-in-progress and proof-of-concept firmware for (usually mechanical)
keyboards, written in [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) and
[CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython). This allows for
high-level and expressive keyboard programming and creature comforts that C
simply doesn't make easy. KMK was heavily inspired by QMK - in fact, KMK was
only created because QMK didn't correctly support some hardware I bought, and
hacking support in was going to be a heavy uphill battle.
