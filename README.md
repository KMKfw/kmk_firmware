KMK is a feature-rich and beginner-friendly firmware for computer keyboards
written and configured in
[CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython).

Synchronous chatter about KMK is available in the official Matrix room,
[#kmkfw:klar.sh](https://matrix.to/#/#kmkfw:klar.sh). (Note: the KMK chat room
is **not** a bug tracker, and it is **not** necessarily monitored by the
maintainer crew, though we may lurk there sometimes.) This channel is bridged
to Discord [here](https://discord.gg/QBHUUpeGUd) for convenience.

## Features

- Fully configured through a single, easy to understand Python file that lives
  on a "flash-drive"-esque space on your microcontroller - edit on the go
  without DFU or other devtooling available!
- Single-piece or [two-piece split
  keyboards](/docs/en/split_keyboards.md)
  are supported
- [Chainable
  keys](/docs/en/keys.md) such as
  `KC.LWIN(KC.L)` to lock the screen on a Windows PC
- [Built-in Unicode macros, including
  emojis](/docs/en/sequences.md)
- [RGB underglow](/docs/en/rgb.md)
  and [LED
  backlights](/docs/en/led.md)
- One key can turn into many more based on [how many times you tap
  it](/docs/en/tapdance.md)
- Bluetooth HID and split keyboards. No more wires.

## Getting Started
KMK requires [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) version 7.0 or higher.
Our getting started guide can be found
[here](/docs/en/Getting_Started.md).

## Code Style

KMK uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) with a Python 3.6 target and,
[(controversially?)](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/594) single quotes.
Further code styling is enforced with isort and flake8 with several plugins.
`make fix-isort fix-formatting` before a commit is a good idea, and CI will fail
if inbound code does not adhere to these formatting rules. Some exceptions are
found in `setup.cfg` loosening the rules in isolated cases, notably
`user_keymaps` (which is *also* not subject to Black formatting for reasons
documented in `pyproject.toml`).

## Tests

Unit tests within the `tests` folder mock various CircuitPython modules to allow
them to be executed in a desktop development environment.

Execute tests using the command `python -m unittest`.
