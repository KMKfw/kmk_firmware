# KMK: Clackety Keyboards Powered by Python

KMK is a feature-rich and beginner-friendly firmware for computer keyboards
written and configured in
[CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython). **KMK is currently
in public beta, however should handle almost all workflows without major
issues**.

You can always find the latest releases on our CDN, in [compiled and
optimized](https://cdn.kmkfw.io/kmk-latest.zip) and [raw, hackable text
file](https://cdn.kmkfw.io/kmk-latest.unoptimized.zip) forms. These follow the
`master` branch here on GitHub.

## Features

- Fully configured through a single, easy to understand Python file that lives
  on a "flash-drive"-esque space on your microcontroller - edit on the go
  without DFU or other devtooling available!
- Single-piece or [two-piece split
  keyboards](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/split_keyboards.md)
  are supported
- [Chainable
  keys](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/keys.md) such as
  `KC.LWIN(KC.L)` to lock the screen on a Windows PC
- [Built-in unicode macros, including
  emojis](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/sequences.md)
- [Multiple vim-inspired leader key
  modes](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/leader.md)
- [RGB underglow](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/rgb.md)
  and [LED
  backlights](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/led.md)
- One key can turn into many more based on [how many times you tap
  it](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/tapdance.md)
- Bluetooth HID and split keyboards. No more wires.

## The KMK Team

KMK is primarily written and maintained by @klardotsh and @kdb424, but
contributions are welcome from all, whether it's in the form of code,
documentation, hardware designs, feature ideas, or anything else that comes to
mind. KMK's contributors and other helpers are listed alphabetically by username
below (we'll try to keep this up to date!):

- [Dan Halbert (@dhalbert)](https://github.com/dhalbert)
- [Elvis PfÃ¼tzenreuter (@elvis-epx)](https://github.com/elvis-epx)
- [Kyle Brown (@kdb424)](https://github.com/kdb424)
- [Josh Klar (@klardotsh)](https://github.com/klardotsh)
- [Limor Fried (@ladyada)](https://github.com/ladyada)
- [Ryan Karpinski (@rk463345)](https://github.com/rk463345)
- [@siddacious](https://github.com/siddacious)
- [Scott Shawcroft (@tannewt)](https://github.com/tannewt)

> While Adafruit employees and affiliates are included in the above list and
> their help has been crucial to KMK's success, KMK is not an official Adafruit
> project, and the Core team is not compensated by Adafruit for its development.

## Code Style

KMK uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) with a Python 3.6 target and,
[(controversially?)](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/594) single quotes.
Further code styling is enforced with isort and flake8 with several plugins.
`make fix-isort fix-formatting` before a commit is a good idea, and CI will fail
if inbound code does not adhere to these formatting rules. Some exceptions are
found in `setup.cfg` loosening the rules in isolated cases, notably
`user_keymaps` (which is *also* not subject to Black formatting for reasons
documented in `pyproject.toml`).
