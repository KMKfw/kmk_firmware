# What is the Aurora Series?

The Aurora series were designed as a homage to open source keyboard kits that have carved their space into the community. Kits that provided something new and unique, kits that resonated with the community and that have both received and have given a lot of love in return.

With the Aurora series, we aim to make these kits available to the community in a way that both honors the original, while also offering the best possible feature set and a consistent, well-documented build experience.

For each kit sold, we give back to the community by donating €1 across [the firmware projects we support](https://opencollective.com/splitkb). This way we support open source projects and benefit everyone using keyboards, whether they use our kits or their own.
