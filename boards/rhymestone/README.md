The Rhymestone is 40-key ortholinear split keyboard. Originally the Rhymestone was created to be sold alongside the Treadstone and used as either a Macro pad or a 10-key numpad, hence the similar naming conventions. However; the Rhymestone is also often used as a standalone split keyboard by people who prefer a 5 column ortholinear layout.
