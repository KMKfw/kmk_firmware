# Pimoroni Keybow family

A family of macro pads based on raspberry pi hardware:

(Original) Keybow - Raspberry Pi hat. 4x3 hotswap keys, with an APA102 LED per key.

![Keybow 2040](image url for keybow 2040)
Keybow 2040 - custom RP2040 board. 4x4 hotswap keys, with an RGB LED per key driven by a shared IS31FL3731 controller.

These boards share the 'feature' of using a single GPIO per key rather than a row and column matrix, so these both
use CircuitPython's `keypad.Keys` module instead of the regular KMK matrix scanner.
