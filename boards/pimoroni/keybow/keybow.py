'''
KMK keyboard for Pimoroni Keybow.

WARNING: This doesn't currently function correctly on the Raspberry Pi Zero,
some of the keys are stuck in the 'pressed' position. There's either a bug in
the keypad implementation on the rpi0, or the pin numbers don't match the pins
in linux.

This is a 4x3 macro pad designed to fit the rpi's GPIO connector. Each key is
attached to a single GPIO and has an APA102 LED mounted underneath it.

The layout of the board is as follows (GPIO connector on the left):

R0 | D20    D6   D22
R1 | D17   D16   D12
R2 | D24   D27   D26
R0 | D13    D5   D23
    ------------------
      C0    C1    C2

This board also functions with an adaptor (see
https://learn.adafruit.com/itsybitsy-keybow-mechanical-keypad/) to work with an
itsybitsy in place of the rpi, which uses an alternate pin mapping:

R0 |  A2    A1    A0
R1 |  A5    A4    A3
R2 | D10    D9    D7
R3 | D11   D12    D2
    ------------------
      C0    C1    C2

This keyboard file should automatically select the correct mapping at runtime.
