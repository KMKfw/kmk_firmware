5x12 ortholinear -- for when just really don't want to give up your number row. The 5x12 ortholinear keyboard is a common ortholinear layout that many people prefer because it includes a number row. Made popular by Jack's Preonic from OLKB, the 5x12 ortholinear layout is a great option for those who want to try ortholinear but feel they aren't ready to make the jump to a 40%. The 5x12 Ortho is an approachable keyboard with hotswap compatibility.
