5x12 ortholinear -- for when just really don't want to give up your number row.
The 5x12 ortholinear keyboard is a common ortholinear layout that many people
prefer because it includes a number row. Made popular by Jack's Preonic from
OLKB, the 5x12 ortholinear layout is a great option for those who want to try
ortholinear but feel they aren't ready to make the jump to a 40%. The 5x12 Ortho
is an approachable keyboard with hotswap compatibility.
