The Reviung41 is a 41 key keyboard designed by gtips, it is a slightly larger version of the popular Reviung 39. These "split non-split" keyboards offer a lot of features split keyboards have in terms of comfort and ergonomics but do so in a single-piece package. Many people consider keyboards in this style easier to travel with since you don't have to manage two halves and there is of course no need for a TRRS cable. This board sits somewhere between and Atreus and Corne, and it is extremely comfortable to use.

kb.py is designed to work with the nice!nano
