Reviung39 is a 39 key keyboard designed by gtips. The Reviung39 sits somewhere between an Atreus and a Corne, you get some nice ergonomic benefits based on its quasi-split design and since a true split keyboard isn't for everyone, this is an awesome middle ground. I find this keyboard extremely comfortable to use.

kb.py is designed to work with the nice!nano
