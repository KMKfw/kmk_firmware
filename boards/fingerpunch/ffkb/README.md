# Faux Fox Keyboard (ffkb)

![ffkb](https://fingerpunch.xyz/product/faux-fox-keyboard)

A 36 or 42 key keyboard with support for per key LEDs, 2 rotary encoders (EC11 or evqwgd001), and a feature in the center (EC11, OLED (128x64), or pimoroni trackball). KMK support is available for the BYO MCU option only.

Use `kb2040/kb.py` when using a KB2040 MCU.

Use `nice_nano/kb.py` when using a Nice!Nano v2 MCU.

> Note: The Nice!Nano doesn't have a lot of ROM, so there are a couple of extra steps. See guidance [over here](../../docs/Officially_Supported_Microcontrollers.md#nicenano).

An example `main.py` file is included for each MCU.
